        <h3>The youngest club among the greats of Brazilian football, São Paulo FC is the most winning club in Brazil!</h3>
        <p>Founded on January 25, 1930 and marked by stories of overcoming, such as the club's re-foundation in 1935 or the difficult times of building Morumbi, <i>Tricolor Mais Querido</i> on the planet is the only Brazilian club to have conquered América and the World for 3 times. He is also the only consecutive three-time champion of the Brazilian Championship and the first to win it six times. Brazilian three-time champion.<br><br>
        Off the field, Tricolor defied critics and logic and built the largest private stadium in Brazil, Estádio do Morumbi. It continued to be a pioneer in its commitment to infrastructure as a pillar of excellence in sport, building its Training Center and Athlete Training Center over time. The result? The world met three times.<br><br>
        Owner of an enviable heritage, holder of unattainable titles for many and in constant movement in search of excellence, Tricolor Paulista lives up to its anthem: among the greats, you are the first!</p>
