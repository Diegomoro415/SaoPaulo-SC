        <h3>The youngest club among the greats of Brazilian football, São Paulo FC is the most winning club in Brazil!</h3>
        <p>Founded on January 25, 1930 and marked by stories of overcoming, such as the club's re-foundation in 1935 or the difficult times of building Morumbi, <i>Tricolor Mais Querido</i> on the planet is the only Brazilian club to have conquered América and the World for 3 times. He is also the only consecutive three-time champion of the Brazilian Championship and the first to win it six times. Brazilian three-time champion.<br><br>
        Off the field, Tricolor defied critics and logic and built the largest private stadium in Brazil, Estádio do Morumbi. It continued to be a pioneer in its commitment to infrastructure as a pillar of excellence in sport, building its Training Center and Athlete Training Center over time. The result? The world met three times.<br><br>
        Owner of an enviable heritage, holder of unattainable titles for many and in constant movement in search of excellence, Tricolor Paulista lives up to its anthem: among the greats, you are the first!</p>

                    O <i>Mito</i> (The Myth), as he is called by the crowd. Rog&eacute;rio Ceni, the greatest idol in the history of Sa&#771;o Paulo Futebol Clube, is the ultimate personification of the tricolor fan on the field. Something that brings us back to the transcendent, to the magical and to everything that cannot be known and understood materially. With leadership and a lot of confidence, he defended our colors for 25 years and won 18 titles in total. He broke records for being the player with the most appearances for the same team and also the goalkeeper with the most goals in the history of world football. In total he played 1237 games and scored 131 goals. <br><br></h5>
