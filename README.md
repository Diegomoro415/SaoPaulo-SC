## Design Choices 
Webpage was designed with the colours of the club, divided but sections go make a easy and fast way for customers get all the relevant information going through the methodolgy, history and sign-up. 

## Colour
Club has 3 main colors so the site works on these 3 colors (Red, White and Black) also add shadow to red and dark grey to work with black. I used Coolors to find the best shade for each color.
